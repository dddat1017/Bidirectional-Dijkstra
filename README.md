# Bidirectional-Dijkstra

## About
Implementation of the Bidirectional Dijktra's algorithm to solve shortest path problems on any weighted directed graph.

## Setup
Read over `graph/Graph.h` to understand requirements for your graph. Derive a subclass from `Graph` and override the pure virtual functions.

For an example, take a look at `graph/WeightedDirectedGraph.h` and `graph/test_weighteddirectedgraph.cpp`. Run `make` to test it out.

Change/update `graph/Makefile` if necessary.
